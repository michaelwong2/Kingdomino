# Kingdomino

_Kingdomino_ [http://www.blueorangegames.com/index.php/games/king-domino] is a 5x5 domino tiling game. Each domino has one or two of five types which determine where it can be placed. The goal of the game is to place as many tiles on the game board while maximizing adjacent area. For more information about the game, see our short paper. 

In this project, we built a Kingdomino simulator to explore the state space/game tree. We also implement a algorithm for computing standard domino tilings on nxn boards. Odd sized boards can also be tiled in our simulation (with an extra starting tile).
